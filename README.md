### Hi there üëã

Hello, I'm a passionate software developer focused on creating software that positively impacts the world. I pride myself on writing high-quality, efficient, and clean code that I can stand behind. I'm always eager to learn and grow as a software engineer, and I welcome any constructive feedback or collaboration opportunities. I'm also new to open-source contributions, so any guidance or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Currently, I'm open to job opportunities or startups that align with my skills and interests. Let's connect if you have any leads or suggestions!
