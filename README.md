### Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm a passionate software developer focused on creating software that positively impacts the world. I pride myself on writing high-quality, efficient, and clean code that I can stand behind. I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I welcome any constructive feedback or collaboration opportunities. I'm also new to open-source contributions, so any guidance or feedback would be greatly appreciated.
